FileInfo v1.3  10/27/88

FileInfo is an Intuitionalized combination of the CLI Rename, FileNote and
Protect commands.  It allows you to display & modify all this information
using string & boolean gadgets.  To run it, just type:
         FileInfo filename

New in this version:
* You can now modify the new 1.3 flags; ie: pure, script & hidden.
  The 'hidden' flag is undocumented and not supported by 1.3, but it does
  exist, so I allow you to modify it for whatever evil purposes you desire.
  Do so at your own risk.
* Hitting <return> in the 'name' gadget will activate the 'note' gadget.
* Hitting <return> in the 'note' gadget is equivalent to clicking on the
  'save' gadget.
* The de/selected status of the flag gadgets has been changed to
  match the flags as displayed by the 'LIST' command.  For instance, if LIST
  says a file's flags are ---aw--d, then the archive, write & delete gadgets
  will be selected.  It makes more sense this way.

All Benchmark Modula2 source & PowerWindows2.5 definition files included.
(You will need the PowerWindows PW2.def & PW2.mod files or equivalent to 
recompile the source.)
Freely distributable for non-commercial use.
