(* used to show that a program is busy doing other things.  When the     *)
(* program completes its task, the pointer is restored to the user's     *)
(* usual mouse pointer.  The image data is set up to display a  rotating *)

PROCEDURE AllocBusyPointers(wp : WindowPtr) : BOOLEAN;
  (* Allocate & initialize the BusyPointer images.  Return TRUE on success *)

PROCEDURE FreeBusyPointers;
  (* Deallocate the BusyPointer images.  Can safely be called even if 
     AllocBusyPointers failed. *)

PROCEDURE SpinBusyPointer(wp : WindowPtr; right : BOOLEAN);
  (* Each call to this procedure will rotate the Boing ball in the 
     direction specified.  To restore the original window pointer,
     use RestorePointer. *)

PROCEDURE RestorePointer(wp : WindowPtr);
  (* Similar to Intuition's ClearPointer, but this also restores the original
     pointer color table. *)
