There are three sample menu definition scripts in this archive, called
menu.1, menu.2 and menu.3.

Please read Zippy.doc FIRST for the full story on whats going in here.


For Zippy to acknowledge these files, they MUST be renamed to "menus.zip"
and placed in the proper directory.  Please note that these files refer
to things specific to MY system.  Dont expect to rename them & start using
them!  They are examples only.

Menu.1 is my global menu script.  It is setup for 2 menus. The global script
MUST be placed in the "s:" directory.  Notice that the menuitem 'Execute'
has a "" for the menu shortcut.  This means it does not have one.  Also,
notice that you may spell out the reward or just use the first letter
(u=unselect, z=zap, r=reread).

Menu.2 is my Modula-2 development local menu script.  It goes in my
development directory, which I have assigned to "m2:"

Menu.3 is a sample of a local script for an animation directory.  I have it
in my "anim:" directory, where I keep my .anim files.  Notice that the
program string includes a command line argument.


Notice how I include spaces in the titles to make things look nice.  Also,
if you specify a menu shortcut key, you must tack on 5 spaces to the title
so they can be displayed properly.
IMPORTANT: If you dont leave enough room for the command key to be displayed,
you'll be inviting the guru!  You've been warned!
